    "text": "Motivation\nMost economies have experienced significant shocks due to Covid Pandemic,resulting in a marked increase in government net debt-to-GDP ratios. For instance,Australian’s general government net debt-to-GDP ratio surged from 24.5% in 2019 to 38.1 in 2021% by (abs2021government?), while the United States’s ratio rose from 106.1% to 121.1% by (fed2023federal?).\nExtensive research has been conducted on the impact of government spending shocks on output, consumption, and other significant macroeconomic indicators. According to economic theory, positive shocks increase output and consumption. However, there has been limited focus on the external sector of the economy, including the real exchange rate, import and export sector. By using SVARs model to identify government spending shocks and examining their relationship with these variables, policymakers can improve the design and implementation of fiscal and monetary policies to respond to unexpected government spending shocks."

This research will primarily focus on the Australian economy to enable a detailed analysis of its response to government spending shocks, while acknowledging that the results may not necessarily apply to other countries due to their unique institutional features and economic characteristics. Future work could explore the extension of the model to other countries to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cross-country variation in response to government spending shocks.\nFirst, I load the pacakge that can directly download the data from the Reserve Bank of Australia (rba2023statistics?).\n\nlibrary(readrba)\nlibrary(tseries)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(zoo)"

    "text": "Variables\n\nConsumption\nThe data on household final consumption expenditure, measured in $million, is recorded quarterly and adjusted for seasonal variations. However, the plot indicates that the data is not stationary. The mean value is changing over time. Macroeconomic variables have these properties. Thus, I turned to the consumption growth data instead. This data measures the year-ended household consumption growth, and shows a decrease in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I conducted an adf test and found that the p-value was 0.01, indicating that the data is stationary. The mean value of the consumption growth is 3.41%, which suggests that the growth rate is fluctuating around this value. This growth rate is stationary over time.\nThe original variable consumption is log - transformed in my model to reduce the scale and match the assumption of normality.\n\nconsumption &lt;- read_rba('H2')\nconsumption$Date &lt;- as.Date(consumption$date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n# Household final consumption expenditure measured in $million\nconsumption2 &lt;- subset(consumption, series_id == \"GGDPECCVPSH\") \nconsumption3 &lt;- subset(consumption,series_id == \"GGDPECCVPSHY\")\nconsumption4 &lt;- merge(consumption2, consumption3, by = \"date\", all = FALSE)\nadf.test(consumption3$value)\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  consumption3$value\nDickey-Fuller = -6.4592, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n# log transform of the level\n\nconsumption2$log_con = log(consumption2$value)\n# Create a line plot of \n\nplot4&lt;- ggplot(data = consumption2, aes(x = Date, y =log_con)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \" Household Consumption (log)\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Index\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\nplot5&lt;- ggplot(data = consumption3, aes(x = Date, y =value)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \" Household Consumption Growth\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Index\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\nconsumption_plot &lt;- plot_grid(plot4, plot5,  ncol = 1, align = \"v\")\nprint(consumption_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP\nthe real GDP was measured in million dollars, and the plot of this data indicates that it is non-stationary due to its increasing trend. In order to address this, I transformed the original variable using the lag() function in R, resulting in the GDP percentage change.\nUpon examining the plot of the GDP percentage change, it appears to be more stationary over time, indicating that this transformed variable may be more suitable for use in the model.It fluctuates a lot during covid period. Therefore, I will proceed with using the GDP percentage change as the variable for the model instead of the original real GDP in million dollars.\n\nGDP &lt;- read_rba('H1')\n\n\nGDP$Date &lt;- as.Date(GDP$date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n# Real GDP\nGDP2 &lt;- subset(GDP, series_id == \"GGDPCVGDP\")\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nGDP2 &lt;- GDP2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage_change = (value - lag(value)) / lag(value) * 100)\n\n# log transform of GDP\nGDP2$log_gdp = log(GDP2$value)\n# Create a line plot of \n\nplot3&lt;- ggplot(data = GDP2, aes(x = Date, y =percentage_change)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \" GDP percentage_change\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Index\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\ngdp_plot&lt;- ggplot(data = GDP2, aes(x = Date, y =log_gdp) )+\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \" GDP(log) \", x = \"Year\", y = \"Index\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\ncombined_gdp &lt;- plot_grid( gdp_plot,plot3, ncol = 1, align = \"v\")\nprint(combined_gdp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExchange rate\nThe real exchange rate data is obtained from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and is provided on a quarterly basis. RBA uses Australian dolloar trade-weighted index as a measure of real exchange rate. It is the price of the Australian dollar interms of a group of foeign currencies based on the share of trade with Australia.\n\n# TWI \nreal_exchange_rate &lt;- read_rba(\"F15\")\nreal_exchange_rate$Date &lt;- as.Date(real_exchange_rate$date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\nreal_exchange_rate_twi &lt;- subset(real_exchange_rate, series_id == \"FRERTWI\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadf.test(real_exchange_rate_twi$value)\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  real_exchange_rate_twi$value\nDickey-Fuller = -1.8165, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.653\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nMoreover, I also examine the nominal exchange rate variable. I download the AUD/USD exchange rate, as the US dollar is widely accepted as an international currency. I transform the daily data into quarterly data with mean. The figure displaying this data is shown below. (Note: The data obtained using the package may not exactly match the description on the website.) However, since the nominal interest rate may be influenced by various factors and also due to data availability, this research will focus solely on the real interest rate(TWI).\n\n# Exchange rate US/AUD not sure if I will use it in the model\n exchange_rate &lt;- read_rba(table_no = 'F11.1')\n# \nexchange_rate$Date &lt;- as.Date(exchange_rate$date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n# Calculate quarterly averages\nexchange_rate_quarterly &lt;- exchange_rate %&gt;%\n mutate(Quarter = as.yearqtr(Date)) %&gt;%\n group_by(Quarter) %&gt;%\n summarize(ExchangeRate = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n# Plot the quarterly data\n\nplot_exchange = ggplot(exchange_rate_quarterly, aes(x = Quarter, y = ExchangeRate)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date\", y = \"Exchange Rate\", title = \"Quarterly Exchange Rate (AUD/USD)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)\n\n\ncombined_plot &lt;- plot_grid( plot1, plot_exchange, ncol = 1, align = \"v\")\n\n# Print the combined plot\nprint(combined_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade balance\nThe trade balance data is measured as a percentage of output and is recorded on a quarterly basis with seasonal adjustments. Upon examining the plot of this data, it appears to have been stationary prior to the COVID period. However, since then, the trade balance has been increasing. I will also have this variable in my model as a control variable.\n\nTrade_balance &lt;- read_rba(\"I1\")\n\nTrade_balance$Date &lt;- as.Date(Trade_balance$date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\nTrade_balance2 &lt;- subset(Trade_balance, series_id == \"HTBGSCPGDP\")\n\n# Create a line plot of real_exchange_rate_twi\nplot2&lt;- ggplot(data = Trade_balance2, aes(x = Date, y = value)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \" Trade balance as a per cent of output\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Index\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\nprint(plot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngovernment spending data\nDue to package contraints, readrba or readabs are not applicable for government spending data because the data published about public sector is yearly based on ABS. I use fred as my data source instead. Government spending is increasing due to the increasing trend, thus I use function lag() to transform this data. Both the figure and the ADF test indicates it is stationary. I will also include this variable in my model.\n\n# Load the library\nlibrary(fredr)\n\n# Set your FRED API key\n\nreadRenviron(\"secret.R\")\napi_key &lt;-Sys.getenv(\"MY_FRED_API_KEY\")\nfredr_set_key(api_key)\n\n# Download the Australian government spending data (quarterly data, seasonally adjusted)\ngov_spending_australia &lt;- fredr(series_id = \"AUSGFCEQDSMEI\",observation_start = as.Date(\"1990-01-01\"))\ngov_spending_australia$log_gov = log(gov_spending_australia$value)\n\ngov_spending_australia &lt;- gov_spending_australia %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage_change = (value - lag(value)) / lag(value) * 100)\n\n# Calculate real government spending\n\n\n\n\n# Check the data\n\nplot_log &lt;- ggplot(gov_spending_australia, aes(x = date, y = log_gov)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Australian Government Spending(log)\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Value\") +\ngeom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \" Australian Government Spending\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Index\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\nplot_gd&lt;-  ggplot(gov_spending_australia, aes(x = date, y = percentage_change )) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Australian Government Spending Percentage change\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Value\") +\ngeom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \" Trade balance as a per cent of output\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Index\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\ngd = plot_grid( plot_log,plot_gd ,ncol = 1, align = \"v\")\nprint(gd)\n\n\n\nadf.test(na.omit(gov_spending_australia$percentage_change))\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  na.omit(gov_spending_australia$percentage_change)\nDickey-Fuller = -3.6596, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.03065\nalternative hypothesis: stationary"
